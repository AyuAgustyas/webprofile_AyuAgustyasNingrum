            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>I am an active fifth-semester student at Trunojoyo Madura University, majoring in Informatics Education. I come from Ponorogo, a city famous for the traditional art of Reog Ponorogo. As the third child among three siblings, I grew up in a family of farmers, which instilled in me the values of hard work and resilience from an early age.

                Continuing my education to the current level has been a challenging journey, but my determination and strong desire to learn have kept me going. I have a dream to change not only my own future but also that of my family through education. Additionally, I have a great interest in outdoor activities, and playing in the great outdoors is something that brings me immense joy.</p>
